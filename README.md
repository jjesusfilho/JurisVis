This packages produces visualizations for judicial decisions’ analysis

## Installation

You can install the development version

``` r
pak::pkg_install("jjesusfilho/JurisVis")
```

## Development status

This package is a gathering of functions and shiny modules that I use to
build dashboards and reports. I am still figuring out whether they
should make up a shiny package or just a set of independent functions.

I haven’t tested its functions enough to ensure they work accordingly.
